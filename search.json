    "text": "Hi, my name is Max Lorsignol.\nI am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Geomatics for Environmental Management at UBC. What is geomatics, you ask? In a nutshell, geomatics is the science and technology of collecting, analyzing, managing, and visualizing spatial data. Ever since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by the maps my father used for his mountaineering adventures. Today, I’m leveraging that lifelong love for mapping and applying it with modern tools and standards to be a part of the conservation and environmental efforts of the 21st century.\nWhen I’m not crafting digital maps or spatial analyses, you’ll find me outdoors, navigating the rugged mountains of the west coast with the same passion for exploration. My goal is to combine the skills I’ve developed through my education and personal experiences to address pressing issues related to environmental management, natural resources, climate change, and land use management. I hope to make a meaningful difference in creating sustainable solutions for the challenges our world faces today.\n\n\n\nGIF of a forest plot with Individual Trees Segmented using li2012, colorized by TreeID"

    "text": "This project focuses on identifying and designating Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures (OECMs) within the Átl’ḵa7tsem/Howe Sound Biosphere Region. Using geospatial data from BC Parcel Data, CPCAD, and ecological sensitivity datasets, the study aims to assess parcels of land for their potential to support biodiversity conservation while meeting the criteria for OECM designation. The methodology involves creating a “mesh sensitivity layer” that integrates critical habitat data, forest age (&gt;200 years), and proximity to streams, combined with parcel attributes like ownership and zoning.\nSpatial analysis, guided by a decision support tool, evaluates parcels based on ecological sensitivity, proximity to existing conservation areas, and governance capacity. The project also examines differences across regional districts (Metro Vancouver, Sunshine Coast, Squamish Lillooet), aiming to prioritize parcels that are unprotected but ecologically significant. Expected results include a map of high-priority OECM candidates, helping to enhance biodiversity conservation while contributing to Canada’s broader conservation goals under the CBD’s Aichi Targets.\n\n\nEach hexagon has a value based on the ecological sensitivity, critical habitat, forest age, proximity to streams and slope steepness.

Fascinated by different classification processes and the maps it produced, I extended this skill to produce a number of classified maps of various landscapes where Landsat and Copernicus satellite data was available. Generally my focus was with the Howe Sound Biosphere as it was part of my capstone project at UBC and is where I spend my time hiking, skiing and climbing. Below are some of the results of recent pixel classifications.\nBelow is a slide-by-side comparison of two different classification processes of the Howe Sound. The left side is classified under a supervised process using hand-delineated polygons, 20/80 training to validation, with custom R code (a lot of work). The right shows a classification using the ArcGIS Pro deeplearning land cover classification (almost instantaneous).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea here is to visualize the difference and address the accuracies between the two classification models. How do you think they compare?"

I applied the BFAST algorithm to detect abrupt changes in vegetation—like logging events—that cause rapid declines in NDVI values. I then examined a 33‐year series of land cover maps from Landsat imagery, reclassifying the data into forested and non-forested areas to evaluate trends in forest loss and gain. Throughout the lab, I developed R code for data extraction, time series creation, and visualization, showcasing my practical skills in spatial and temporal analysis with packages such as terra, sf, and bfast."
