    "text": "Hi, my name is Max Lorsignol.\nI am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Geomatics for Environmental Management at UBC. What is geomatics, you ask? In a nutshell, geomatics is the science and technology of collecting, analyzing, managing, and visualizing spatial data. Ever since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by the maps my father used for his mountaineering adventures. Today, I’m leveraging that lifelong love for mapping and applying it to modern tools and standards.\nWhen I’m not crafting digital maps or spatial analyses, you’ll find me outdoors, navigating the rugged mountains of the west coast with the same passion for exploration. My goal is to combine the skills I’ve developed through my education and personal experiences to address pressing issues related to environmental management, natural resources, climate change, and land use management. I hope to make a meaningful difference in creating sustainable solutions for the challenges our world faces today."

    "text": "This project focuses on identifying and designating Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures (OECMs) within the Átl’ḵa7tsem/Howe Sound Biosphere Region. Using geospatial data from BC Parcel Data, CPCAD, and ecological sensitivity datasets, the study aims to assess parcels of land for their potential to support biodiversity conservation while meeting the criteria for OECM designation. The methodology involves creating a “mesh sensitivity layer” that integrates critical habitat data, forest age (&gt;200 years), and proximity to streams, combined with parcel attributes like ownership and zoning.\nSpatial analysis, guided by a decision support tool, evaluates parcels based on ecological sensitivity, proximity to existing conservation areas, and governance capacity. The project also examines differences across regional districts (Metro Vancouver, Sunshine Coast, Squamish Lillooet), aiming to prioritize parcels that are unprotected but ecologically significant. Expected results include a map of high-priority OECM candidates, helping to enhance biodiversity conservation while contributing to Canada’s broader conservation goals under the CBD’s Aichi Targets.\n\n\nSample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page here.\n\nmain_map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‘tabset’ in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let’s showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\ncalc_ndvi &lt;- function(nir, red){ ndvi &lt;- (nir-red)/(nir+red) return(ndvi) }\n\n\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir.astype(float)-red.astype(float))/(nir.astype(float)+red.astype(float))\n  return(ndvi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a link to a Google Earth Engine application I developed. The full-screen GEE application is available here in case you’re interested.\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you’d like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point. Areas where the maximum temp exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in your date-range are highlighted in red.)"
